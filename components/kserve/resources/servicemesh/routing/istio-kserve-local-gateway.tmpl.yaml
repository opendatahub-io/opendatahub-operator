# This Gateway is used for KServe internal communication. Each InferenceService (ISVC) will update this Gateway, particularly by adding a Server that includes TLS settings, hosts, and port configurations. This Gateway is created by the OpenDataHub Operator as a feature, but it will not be managed by the OpenDataHub Operator after its creation.
