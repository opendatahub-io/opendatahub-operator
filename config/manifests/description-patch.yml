    The Open Data Hub is a machine-learning-as-a-service platform built on Red Hat's Kubernetes-based OpenShiftÂ® Container Platform. Open Data Hub integrates multiple AI/ML open source components into one operator that can easily be downloaded and installed by OpenShift users.
    
    Open Data Hub operator allows users to install and manage components of the Open Data Hub. Users can mix and match tools from each project to fulfill the needs of their use case. Each of the projects share some components, but can be mostly seen as an extension of each other to provide a complete solution for both novice and skilled enterprise users.
        
    ### Components
    
    * Open Data Hub Dashboard - A web dashboard that displays installed Open Data Hub components with easy access to component UIs and documentation
    * ODH Notebook Controller - Secure management of Jupyter Notebook in Kubernetes environments built on top of Kubeflow Notebook Controller with support for OAuth
    * Jupyter Notebooks - JupyterLab notebook that provide Python support for GPU workloads
    * Data Science Pipelines - Pipeline solution for end to end MLOps workflows that support the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK and Tekton
    * Model Mesh - ModelMesh Serving is the Controller for managing ModelMesh, a general-purpose model serving management/routing layer
    * Distributed Workloads(Incubation) - Stack built to make managing distributed compute infrastructure in the cloud easy and intuitive for Data Scientists. This stack consists of three components 
                                          Codeflare , KubeRay and Kueue.
    * Kserve - Kserve is the Controller for for serving machine learning (ML) models on arbitrary frameworks
