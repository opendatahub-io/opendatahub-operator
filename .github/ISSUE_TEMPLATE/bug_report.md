# What

In the summer of 2023, a new operator, v2, was released with enhanced support for ODH. 
For more details, please refer to the blog post: [ODH Operator v2.0 Blog]([https://opendatahub.io/blog/2023-07-24-odh-operator-v2.0-blog/)

During the autumn of 2023, the project decided to end the support period for ODH operator v1. The release version v1.11.0 marks the final release for operator v1; thereafter, v2.4.0 takes over. Consequently, no new feature developments or bug fixes will be pursued for v1.

# How

We strongly recommend you switch from v1 to v2, see upgrade blog: https://opendatahub.io/docs/upgrading-open-data-hub/#upgrading-the-odh-operator-v1_upgradev
