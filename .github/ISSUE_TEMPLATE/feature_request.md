**Updates**

In the winter of 2023, we transitioned GitHub Issues to the Red Hat Jira issue board located at https://issues.redhat.com. 
Moving forward, kindly utilize this platform for reporting any new issues.

All previous issues from GitHub have been seamlessly migrated to the issue board, accompanied by a link directing users to the corresponding old issues for follow-up.

**How To**

- Login Jira issue board https://issues.redhat.com
- Click "Create" on top
- Choose: "Pojrect 'Red Hat Openshift Data Science'"
- Issue Type:
  - if it is a bug, choose "Bug"
  - if it is a new feature requirement, choose "Feature"
  - if it is an enhancement work, choose "Task"
- Fill in "Summary" with a clear and concise description of what the ticket is.
- Add "Description" with detail information, see below:
  - Describe the bug***
    - on which branch, bug is observed:
    - has it worked before/ in which version it starts breaking:
    - etc
  - Steps to reproduce the behavior if it is a "Bug" type:
    1. Go to '...'
    2. Click on '....'
    3. Scroll down to '....'
    4. See error
  - Expected behavior: a clear and concise description of what you expect to happen.
  - Additional context: Add any other context about the ticket here.
- Choose: "Components/s: 'Platform'"
- Attachment: if applicable, upload screenshots to help explain more.

**Troubleshooting**

- If you do not have Red Hat account, you will need to create one for the first time to log in to the Jira issue board.
- If you are unsure about certain fields when creating an issue ticket, you can leave them blank.
- If you encounter any blocker despite your efforts, feel free to use GitHub Issue. We will assist you in mirroring GitHub issues to the issue board. Please note that this approach may take longer than creating a Jira ticket directly in the issue board.
