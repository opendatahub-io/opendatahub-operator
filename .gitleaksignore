# .gitleaksignore - Exclude test fixtures and mock data from Gitleaks secret scanning
#
# These are mock credentials used in unit tests and should not be flagged as security issues.
# Real credentials should NEVER be committed to this repository.
#
# Documentation: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#gitleaksignore

# Test data directories with mock credentials
**/testdata/**/*.yaml
**/testdata/**/*.yml
**/testdata/**/*_mock.go
**/testdata/**/*mock.go
**/testdata/**/test-*.yaml
**/testdata/**/test-*.yml

# Note: This file should be reviewed regularly to ensure test data exclusions remain appropriate.
# Production code and configuration files are still scanned for secrets.
