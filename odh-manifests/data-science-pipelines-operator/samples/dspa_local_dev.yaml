# A simple DSPA with the Database and ObjectStore Health Checks Disabled
#
# Since the default database and storage options leverage internal Services,
# a locally-run DSPO that manages an external cluster (common development practice)
# would not be able to run the pre-deploy health checks on these prerequisite components
# and therefore the DSPA will never fully deploy without disabling them, as this DSPA sample does
