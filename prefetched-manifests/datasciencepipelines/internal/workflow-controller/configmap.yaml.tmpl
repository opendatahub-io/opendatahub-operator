      # keyFormat is a format pattern to define how artifacts will be organized in a bucket.
      # It can reference workflow metadata variables such as workflow.namespace, workflow.name,
      # pod.name. Can also use strftime formating of workflow.creationTimestamp so that workflow
      # artifacts can be organized by date. If omitted, will use `\{\{workflow.name\}\}/\{\{pod.name\}\}`,
      # which has potential for have collisions, because names do not guarantee they are unique
      # over the lifetime of the cluster.
      # Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/.
      #
      # The following format looks like:
      # artifacts/my-workflow-abc123/2018/08/23/my-workflow-abc123-1234567890
      # Adding date into the path greatly reduces the chance of \{\{pod.name\}\} collision.
      # keyFormat: "artifacts/\{\{workflow.name\}\}/\{\{workflow.creationTimestamp.Y\}\}/\{\{workflow.creationTimestamp.m\}\}/\{\{workflow.creationTimestamp.d\}\}/\{\{pod.name\}\}"  # TODO
