                description: |-
                  ArtifactsDestination is the server-side destination for MLflow artifacts (models, plots, files).
                  This setting only applies when ServeArtifacts is enabled. When ServeArtifacts is disabled,
                  this field is ignored and clients access artifact storage directly.
                  Supported schemes: file://, s3://, gs://, wasbs://, hdfs://, etc.
                  Examples:
                    - "file:///mlflow/artifacts" (requires Storage to be configured)
                    - "s3://my-bucket/mlflow/artifacts" (no Storage needed)
                    - "gs://my-bucket/mlflow/artifacts" (no Storage needed)
                  If not specified when ServeArtifacts is enabled, defaults to "file:///mlflow/artifacts"

                  For cloud storage authentication, use EnvFrom to inject credentials from secrets or configmaps.
                  Example for S3:
                    envFrom:
                    - secretRef:
                        name: aws-credentials  # Contains AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
                  Example for GCS:
                    envFrom:
                    - secretRef:
                        name: gcp-credentials  # Contains GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path

                  Supported schemes: file://, sqlite://, mysql://, postgresql://, etc.
                  Examples:
                    - "sqlite:////mlflow/mlflow.db" (requires Storage to be configured)
                  Note: For URIs containing credentials, prefer using BackendStoreURIFrom for security.
                  If not specified, defaults to "sqlite:////mlflow/mlflow.db"
                type: string
              backendStoreUriFrom:
                description: |-
                  BackendStoreURIFrom is a reference to a secret containing the backend store URI.
                  Use this instead of BackendStoreURI when the URI contains credentials.
                  Takes precedence over BackendStoreURI if both are specified.

                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                  ServeArtifacts determines whether MLflow should serve artifacts.
                  When enabled, adds the --serve-artifacts flag to the MLflow server and uses ArtifactsDestination
                  to configure where artifacts are stored. This allows clients to log and retrieve artifacts
                  through the MLflow server's REST API instead of directly accessing the artifact storage.
                  When disabled, ArtifactsDestination is ignored and clients must have direct access to artifact storage.

                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.

                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                        If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

                  Workers is the number of uvicorn worker processes for the MLflow server.
                  Note: This is different from pod replicas. Each pod will run this many worker processes.
                  Defaults to 1. For high-traffic deployments, consider increasing pod replicas instead.

                  conditions represent the current state of the MLflow resource.
                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Available": the resource is fully functional
                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
