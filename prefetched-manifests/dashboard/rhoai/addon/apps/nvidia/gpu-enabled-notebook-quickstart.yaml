        ### Prerequisites

        - You have launched a workbench with at least 1 GPU attached. For help, run the "Installing and verifying NVIDIA GPU add-on" quick start.

        ### Procedure

        1. In Jupyter, click the **Git** menu.
        2. Click **Clone a repository**.
        3. Enter URL of the repository to be cloned : **https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/getting-started-with-gpus** and click **Clone**.

          Can you see a getting-started-with-gpus directory in the file navigation pane in Jupyter?
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully cloned the notebook repository into your workbench environment.
        failed: Ensure you have met the prerequisites for the GPU add-on and try the steps again.
    - title: Run the "Using GPU resources with PyTorch" notebook
      description: |-
        1. Double click the **torch-use-gpu.ipynb** file to open the "Using GPU resources with PyTorch" notebook.
        2. Read through and run each step in the notebook file to learn how to check for an available GPU and use the GPU to train a simple model. Detailed explanations of each step are provided in the notebook.

      review:
        instructions: |-
          Were you able to run all steps in the **torch-use-gpu.ipynb** file?
        failedTaskHelp: Ensure that you have at least one GPU node available in your cluster and then try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully trained a model while using a GPU.
        failed: Try the steps again.
    - title: Run the "Loading and running a trained model with PyTorch" notebook
