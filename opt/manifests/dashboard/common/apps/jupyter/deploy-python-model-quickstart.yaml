  prerequisites: [You completed the "Create a Jupyter notebook" quick start.]
  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to deploy a Python model.
    Open Data Hub lets you run Jupyter notebooks in a scalable OpenShift hybrid cloud environment.

    This quick start shows how to create a development sandbox by taking your model out of a Jupyter notebook and putting it into a Flask application that runs on OpenShift Dedicated. 
  tasks:
    - title: Create a new GitHub repository from the s2i Flask template
      description: |-
       The s2i Flask template provides a simple s2i Python project with notebooks included.
        ### To create a new repository from the s2i Flask template:
        1. Navigate to `https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-s2i-project-simple`.
        2. Click **Use this template**.
        3. Type a *Repository name* for your new repository.
        4. Select the **Public** radio button to ensure that the repository is visible.
        5. Click **Create repository from template**.

        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that you created a new repository:
          In GitHub's **Your repositories** section, do you see the repository that you created from the s2i Flask template?
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have created a new GitHub repository.
        failed: Try the steps again.
    - title: Deploy the sample Flask Python model
      description: |-
        ### Deploy the sample Flask application on OpenShift:
        1. Click the **code** button from your newly created repository and copy the URL for your project.
        2. Navigate to your OpenShift Dedicated web console and ensure you are in the **Developer** perspective.
        3. Use the **Project** dropdown to select your OpenShift project, or create a new one.
        4. Click **+Add**.
        5. Click the **From Git** card.
        6. Paste the URL for your project (copied in step 1) into the **Git Repo URL** field. Some of the other fields on the page are auto-filled.
        7. Under **Builder Image**, click **Python**.
        8. Click **Create**.  
        9. In the **Topology** view, watch the deployment build and start.

        The application will deploy and indicate that the system is running.

        instructions: |-
          #### To verify that you have deployed the Flask Python model:
          In the **Topology** view, click on the application and then check under **Builds**. You should see something like `Build #1 is complete (a minute ago)` alongside a green check mark.
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: The deployed application has started.
        failed: Try the steps again.
    - title: Test the prediction function in the deployed model
      description: |-
        ### To test the sample Flask application:
        1. In the **Topology** view, click the application.
        2. Under **Routes**, copy the URL.
        3. In a Jupyter notebook, navigate to a terminal view.
        4. Run the following `curl` command, using the URL that you copied in step 2.
        ```
        curl -X POST -d '{"hello" ":" "world"}' <URL>/prediction
        ```
        For example:
        ```
        curl -X POST -d '{"hello" ":" "world"}' http://example.apps.organization.abc3.p4.openshiftapps.com/prediction
        ```

        This command should return `{"prediction":"not implemented"}` as output.

        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that your deployed application is working:
          Did you receive the response `{"prediction" '':'' "not implemented"}`?
        failedTaskHelp:
          This task is not verified yet. Make sure your application built correctly. Make sure you remembered to add `/prediction` to the end of the application URL to get to the endpoint.
      summary:
        success: You have verified that the sample model deployment is executing!
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You are now able to deploy a sample model stored in GitHub.
