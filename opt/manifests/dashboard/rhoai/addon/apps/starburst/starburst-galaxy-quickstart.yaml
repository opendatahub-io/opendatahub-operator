  introduction: |-
    ### This quickstart shows you how to query data through Starburst Galaxy using a Jupyter notebook.
    Red Hat® OpenShift® AI lets you connect to your Starburst Galaxy instance(s) to provide you with lightning fast query federation capabilities.

    In a matter of minutes, you will be able to access data from multiple sources with a single query using a Jupyter notebook.

    Before you begin, please be sure to clone the [Starburst Galaxy 101 GitHub repo](https://github.com/starburstdata/rhods-starburst-101.git) to your local machine.

    A recording of this quickstart is available [here](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/11/22/access-more-data-your-jupyter-notebook) in case you are unsure of how to complete any of the tasks.

    - title: Launch Starburst Galaxy
      description: |-
        ### To launch Starburst Galaxy:
        1. Click **Applications** &#x2192; **Explore**.
        2. Find the **Starburst Galaxy** card.
        3. Click **Get started** on the **Starburst Galaxy** card.  A new browser tab will open displaying the sign-up page for Starburst Galaxy.
        4. Click on **Start Free**.  Provide your first name, last name and business email address, then click on **Create Account**.
        5. On the Welcome page for Starburst Galaxy, follow the on-screen instructions to finish registering your Staburst Galaxy instance.  The email field should already be filled in and the activiation code should be sitting in your email inbox.  **Be sure to remember your password as this will be needed when connecting client tools to Starburst Galaxy.**
        6. After completing the registration steps, you will be taken to the management console for your Starburst Galaxy instance.  Some sample data is provided for you to get started with and a **sample** cluster should already be running for you to start running queries.
        7. On the **<> Query Editor** page, run a simple query to confirm the cluster is working:  SELECT * FROM tpch.sf1.customer limit 40

        You should see the results of your query populated on the screen.

    - title: Launch Jupyter from Red Hat OpenShift AI
      description: |-
        ### To launch a Jupyter notebook server from within the Red Hat OpenShift AI console:
        1. Click **Applications** &#x2192; **Enabled**.
        2. Find the **Jupyter** card.
        3. Click **Launch** on the Jupyter card to access the Jupyter **Start a notebook server** page.  A new browser tab will open displaying the **Start a notebook server** page.
        4. Select the **Standard Data Science** notebook image and the **Default** container size.
        5. Add the environment variables for **TRINO\_USERNAME**, **TRINO\_PASSWORD**, **TRINO\_HOSTNAME**, and **TRINO\_PORT** using the connection details you obtained in the previous task.
        6. Click on **Start server** to launch Jupyter.

        If you have not previously authorized the jupyterhub-hub service account to access your account, the **Authorize Access** page appears prompting you to provide authorization. Inspect the permissions selected by default, and click the **Allow selected permissions** button.

        The **Start a notebook server** page will reload and indicate that the system is starting up.
