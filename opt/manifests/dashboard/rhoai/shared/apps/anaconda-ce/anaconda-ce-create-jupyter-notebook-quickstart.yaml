      summary:
        success: You have successfully subscribed to Anaconda Professional.
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You are now able to install Anaconda Professional packages within your Jupyter notebook using the command `conda install $PACKAGE`.  If you want to learn how to deploy a model, take the next quick start.
