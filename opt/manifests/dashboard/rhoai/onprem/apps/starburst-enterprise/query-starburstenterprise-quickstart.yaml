  description: This quickstart will walk you through using a Jupyter notebook to query data through Starburst Enterprise.
  introduction: |-
    ### This quickstart shows you how to query data through Starburst Enterprise using a Jupyter notebook.
    Red Hat® OpenShift® AI lets you connect to your Starburst Enterprise instance(s) to provide you with lightning fast query federation capabilities.

    In a matter of minutes, you will be able to access data from multiple sources with a single query using a Jupyter notebook.

    **Prerequisites**
    Before you begin, please be sure you have completed the following tasks:
     - Clone the [Red Hat OpenShift AI + Starburst 101 GitHub repo](https://github.com/starburstdata/rhods-starburst-101) to your local machine.
     - Install Starburst Enterprise on your OpenShift cluster by following the [Starburst Enterprise Helm operator deployment](https://docs.starburst.io/ecosystems/redhat/openshift-deployment.html#installation) guide.

    A recording of this quickstart is available [here](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/11/22/access-more-data-your-jupyter-notebook) in case you are unsure of how to complete any of the tasks.
  tasks:
    - title: Confirm your Starburst Enterprise deployment
      description: |-
        ### To confirm your Starburst Enterprise deployment:
        Complete all 4 steps of the [getting started](https://github.com/starburstdata/starburst-rhpds/tree/main/getting-started) guide.  This will confirm that your Starburst Enterprise cluster is running, that you have multiple data sources configured in your cluster and that you are able to query those data sources.

        You should see results in the Starburst Enterprise query editor results pane after running the query at the bottom of the guide.

        instructions: |-
          #### To verify your Starburst Enterprise cluster has been deployed successfully:
          Are you able to run a query from the **Query Editor** page?
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have confirmed that your Starburst Enterprise cluster has been deployed successfully.  Proceed to the next step.
        failed: Try the steps again.

    - title: Get Starburst Enterprise connection details
      description: |-
        ### Obtain the connection details for your Starburst Enterprise cluster:
        The hostname for your Starburst Enterprise cluster is the same as the URL you used to access the Starburst web UI, but with the protocol (http/https) removed.  The hostname will be needed to connect to your Starburst cluster from a Jupyter notebook.

        For example, if the URL for your Starburst web UI is:
        **https://console-openshift-console.apps.test-cluster.example.com**


        Then the hostname for your Starburst cluster is:
        **console-openshift-console.apps.test-cluster.example.com**


        Confirm the port number for you Starburst cluster.  The default port is **443** for clusters with TLS enabled and is **8080** for clusters with TLS disabled.

        instructions: |-
          #### To verify you have all the connection details you need:
          Do you have the hostname copied somewhere for your Starburst Enterprise cluster?  Have you verified the port number for your Starburst Enterprise cluster?
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have all of the connection details you need to connect to your Starburst Enterprise cluster.  Proceed to the next step.
        failed: Try the steps again.

    - title: Launch Jupyter from Red Hat OpenShift AI
      description: |-
        ### To launch a Jupyter notebook server from within the Red Hat OpenShift AI console:
        1. Click **Applications** &#x2192; **Enabled**.
        2. Find the **Jupyter** card.
        3. Click **Launch** on the Jupyter card to access the Jupyter **Start a notebook server** page.  A new browser tab will open displaying the **Start a notebook server** page.
        4. Select the **Standard Data Science** notebook image and the **Default** container size.
        5. Add the environment variables for **TRINO\_USERNAME**, **TRINO\_PASSWORD**, **TRINO\_HOSTNAME**, and **TRINO\_PORT** using the connection details you obtained in the previous task.
        6. Click on **Start server** to launch Jupyter.

        If you have not previously authorized the jupyterhub-hub service account to access your account, the **Authorize Access** page appears prompting you to provide authorization. Inspect the permissions selected by default, and click the **Allow selected permissions** button.

        The **Start a notebook server** page will reload and indicate that the system is starting up.

        instructions: |-
          #### To verify that you have launched a Jupyter notebook server:
          Do you see a message in the page that says **The server is starting up**?
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: Your notebook server has started and the JupyterLab interface will load shortly. When the page displays a **Stop** option, proceed to the next step.
        failed: Try the steps again.

    - title: Run the **explore-data.ipynb** Jupyter notebook
      description: |-
        ### To run the **explore-data.ipynb** notebook:
        1. If you haven't already done so, clone the [Red Hat OpenShift AI + Starburst 101 GitHub repo](https://github.com/starburstdata/rhods-starburst-101) to your local machine.
        2. Open the **explore-data.ipynb** notebook within your JupyterLab interface.
        3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to install the required packages and initialize the environment.
        4. Run the cells under the **What is Starburst and how does it work?** section to confirm you are connected to your Starburst Enterprise cluster.
        5. Run the cells under the **Accessing Data** section to confirm you are able to execute queries against your Starburst Enterprise cluster.

        You have now successfully connected a Jupyter notebook to your Starburst Enterprise cluster and executed queries against that cluster.
      review:
        instructions: |-
          #### Verify you are connected to your Starburst Enterprise cluster:
          Did you get results when you ran the cells mentioned in step #3 and step #4?
        failedTaskHelp:
          This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have connected to Starburst Enterprise using a Jupyter notebook.
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You are now able to create a Starburst Enterprise cluster and connect a Jupyter notebook to that cluster to execute queries against it.  For more information on how to use Starburst Enterprise, please refer to the [online documentation](https://docs.starburst.io/latest/index.html).
