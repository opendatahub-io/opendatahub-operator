# For most use-cases, it makes sense to schedule one Ray pod per Kubernetes node.
# This is a configuration for an autoscaling RayCluster with 1 Ray head pod and 1 Ray worker pod,
# with capacity to scale up to 10 worker pods.
# Each pod requests 54 Gi memory and 14 CPU.
# Each pod can be scheduled on a virtual machine with roughly 64 Gi memory and 16 CPU.
# (AWS: m5.4xlarge, GCP: e2-standard-16, Azure: Standard_D5_v2)
# Optimal resource allocation will depend on your Kubernetes infrastructure and might
# require some experimentation.

# The Ray autoscaler and KubeRay operator scale Ray pod quantities.
# To achieve Kubernetes node autoscaling with this example, we recommend setting up an autoscaling node group/pool with
# - 2 nodes minimum for the Ray head pod and Ray worker pod
# - 11 nodes maximum to accommodate up to 10 Ray worker pods.
