  # submissionMode specifies how RayJob submits the Ray job to the RayCluster.
  # The default value is "K8sJobMode", meaning RayJob will submit the Ray job via a submitter Kubernetes Job.
  # The alternative value is "HTTPMode", indicating that KubeRay will submit the Ray job by sending an HTTP request to the RayCluster.

  # shutdownAfterJobFinishes specifies whether the RayCluster should be deleted after the RayJob finishes. Default is false.

  # ttlSecondsAfterFinished specifies the number of seconds after which the RayCluster will be deleted after the RayJob finishes.

  # activeDeadlineSeconds is the duration in seconds that the RayJob may be active before
  # KubeRay actively tries to terminate the RayJob; value must be positive integer.
  # activeDeadlineSeconds: 120

  # Suspend specifies whether the RayJob controller should create a RayCluster instance.
  # If a job is applied with the suspend field set to true, the RayCluster will not be created and we will wait for the transition to false.
  # If the RayCluster is already created, it will be deleted. In the case of transition to false, a new RayCluste rwill be created.
  # suspend: false

  # rayClusterSpec specifies the RayCluster instance to be created by the RayJob controller.
